# Ownbound

Ownbound is a thought-provoking game that explores the relationship between society, possessions, and power. Set in a dystopian world where individuals are valued based on their belongings, players face moral choices that shape both their personal journey and the fate of society.

## Game Overview

In Ownbound, players navigate through a world where materialism reigns supreme. The game offers three distinct paths to confront the final boss, each with its own unique consequences:

1. **Collector**: Gather items to challenge the boss directly.
2. **Freedom**: Avoid all items, inspiring the populace to utilize resources for the common good and eventually rise against the ruling overlords.
3. **Greed**: Collect every available item, altering character interactions and becoming a greed-driven entity more formidable than the overlords themselves.

At its core, Ownbound presents a narrative about consumption and power, where player choices regarding item collection and usage influence the society's fate and the player's legacy within this dystopian world.
